<br>
Thanks to every one for the kind emails , im glad you like the framework<br>
if you done something with the framework it will be nice to drop me email with example<br>
or tell me how did it help you.<br>
<b>also if you need Facebook integration solutions email me.</b> <br>
you can check out this very cool game that is already using the framework:<br>
<a href='http://www.instrumentchamp.com/'>http://www.instrumentchamp.com/</a><br><br>
<b>UPDATES!!</b> <br>
I added working demo to show how this framework can be used to integrate </br>
facebook in to your desktop applications and games. only by loading one dll that encapsulates all the logic and expose simple API<br>
please download it here : <a href='http://code.google.com/p/facebook-cpp-graph-api/downloads/detail?name=win32demo_connecting_facebook_v01.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges'>win32demo_connecting_facebook.zip</a> <br>
the demo is win32 native c++ application that using the framework to Authenticate and Authorize the user <br>
and then sending massages when button pressed to the application wall or to the user wall (status)<br>
the zip contains :<br>
What this demo contains is:<br>
<ol><li>win32Host.exe you start the demo by starting win32Host.exe !<br>
</li><li>fbHalper.dll contains all the logic of loading the browser component, and managing the https requests to facebook API<br>
</li><li>TempletProject.exe Qt webkit component that responsible to Authenticate and Authorize the user</li></ol>

also to use it please go to the app link and like it! so you could use the application<br>
<a href='http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=189927794387507&sk=wall'>win32demo facebook application page</a><br>
Im working on OpenGL demo .. Stay tuned.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>

Current release of Facebook cpp Api :<br>
<ol><li>removed all the GUI stuff only the browser component remains for the Authentication.<br>
</li><li>The code more compact and easier  to follow.<br>
</li><li>added jsoncpp open source library for easy and fast json parsing (static compilation, public license) .<br>
</li><li>Compiled and tested with Qt creator And visual studio express , with the same source base. as i see it linux porting now will be easy <br>
</li><li>Used Qt 4.8 for visual studio , and Qt 4.8 for mingw with Qt Creator 2.1 on windows xp 32 bit<br>
</li><li>For the api example I implemented some cool api that lets you aggregate data from group and export it to whatever format you wish .<br>
</li><li>I for example used the framework to got the data from FB music group and exported the data to CVS file , then this CVS file I imported to Google doces .<br>
You can see the end result of the demo here:<br>

Because Facebook graph api demand browser component to authorize the user in desktop applications i used the wonderful Qt 4.7 GUI framework (LGPL).<br>
it compiled with visual studio express 2008 and Qt creator on win XP 32 bit but supposed to work on all platforms i haven't got the time to test it on Linux and i don't own mac<br> and was written purely during the spare time.<br>



<b><i>my suggestion is:</i></b><br>
if you developer just open the code in the IDE put some break points understand the concept and if you wish just adopt it in your code.<br>
<br>
if you have any cool ideas on how to use this code and you need help please email me<br>

<br>Enjoy.<br>
